Generally speaking, Microsoft Azure is a pretty good tool for data processing. It can connect with Datagrip so that it's possible to edit SQL queries at local and run it with cloud service. However, setting up the connection between Azure and IDEs is a pretty difficult process. I cannot figure out he portal of database and server address without help from Ms. Hutchison. The original query editor in Azure is only a preview version. Working process won't be saved if user switches the page. In my opinion, Azure as a DBMS is pretty immature, and maybe it's too early for Microsoft to put them in the market and make profit, since its service doesn't worth the price.
